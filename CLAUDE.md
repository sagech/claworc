# Claworc

## Project Overview

OpenClaw Orchestrator (Claworc) manages multiple OpenClaw instances in Kubernetes or Docker.
Each instance runs in its own container/pod and allows users easy access to a Chromium browser & terminal 
for collaboration with the agent.

The project consists of the following components:
* Control Plane (Golang backend and React frontend) with dashboard, VNC client for Chromium, Terminal, Logs and other useful stuff.
* Agent image with OpenClaw installed. It is compatible with both ARM64 and AMD64 architectures.
* Helm chart for deployment to Kubernetes.

## Architecture

**Backend** (`control-plane/main.go`): Go Chi router with graceful shutdown. Initializes SQLite (GORM) and orchestrator 
(Docker or K8s). The built React SPA is embedded into the binary using Go's `embed` package and served via 
SPA middleware for client-side routing.

**API routes**: All under `/api/v1/`. Instance CRUD at `/api/v1/instances`, settings at `/api/v1/settings`, 
health at `/health`. Logs are streamed via SSE. WebSocket proxying for chat and VNC.

**K8s integration** (`internal/orchestrator/kubernetes.go`): Uses the official Go `client-go` library. 
Tries in-cluster config first, falls back to kubeconfig for local dev.

**Docker integration** (`internal/orchestrator/docker.go`): Alternative orchestrator backend using the Docker API 
for local development.

**Per-instance K8s resources**: Each bot instance creates 8 resources: Deployment, Service (NodePort), 
2 PVCs (homebrew, claworc home folder with Openclaw config &  chromium profile data), Secret (API keys), 
ConfigMap (clawdbot.json). All named with `bot-{name}` prefix in the `claworc` namespace.

**Crypto** (`internal/crypto/crypto.go`): API keys encrypted at rest in SQLite using Fernet. The Fernet key is 
auto-generated on first run and stored in the `settings` table.

**SSH Proxy** (`internal/sshproxy/`): Unified package consolidating SSH key management, connection management, tunnel management, health monitoring, automatic reconnection, connection state tracking, and connection event logging. Contains eight files: `keys.go` (ED25519 key pair generation/persistence), `manager.go` (SSHManager — one multiplexed SSH connection per instance), `tunnel.go` (TunnelManager — reverse SSH tunnels over managed connections), `health.go` (connection health monitoring with metrics), `reconnect.go` (automatic reconnection with exponential backoff and connection state events), `tunnel_health.go` (TCP-level tunnel health monitoring with per-tunnel metrics), `state.go` (per-instance connection state machine with transition history), and `events.go` (per-instance connection event logging with ring buffer). All connections and tunnels are keyed by database instance ID (`uint`), not by name, so they remain stable across instance renames. TunnelManager depends on SSHManager for connections; a background reconciliation loop ensures tunnels stay healthy. A background health checker runs every 30s, executing `echo ping` over SSH to verify end-to-end command execution (complementing protocol-level keepalives). Per-connection metrics track connected-at time, last health check, and success/failure counts. A separate tunnel health checker runs every 60s, probing each tunnel's local TCP port to verify the listener is alive; failed tunnels are marked as "error" for the reconciliation loop to recreate. Per-tunnel metrics (`TunnelMetrics`) track creation time, last health check, success/failure counts; per-instance reconnection counts track how many times tunnels have been recreated. When a health check or keepalive fails, automatic reconnection is triggered with exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s cap, up to 10 retries). Each reconnection attempt re-uploads the global public key via `ConfigureSSHAccess` before connecting (the agent container may have restarted, losing `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`). Connection events (`connected`, `disconnected`, `reconnecting`, `reconnected`, `reconnect_failed`, `key_uploaded`, `health_check_failed`) are emitted to registered `EventListener` callbacks for observability and automatically recorded in a per-instance ring buffer (100 entries) for debugging, accessible via `GetEventHistory(instanceID)` and the `GET /api/v1/instances/{id}/ssh-events` endpoint. Per-instance connection state (`ConnectionState`: Disconnected, Connecting, Connected, Reconnecting, Failed) is tracked automatically by the SSHManager lifecycle methods (Connect, Close, keepalive, reconnect). State transitions are recorded in a per-instance ring buffer (50 entries) for debugging, accessible via `GetStateTransitions(instanceID)`. `StateChangeCallback` functions can be registered via `OnStateChange` for UI updates or alerting.

**SSH Source IP Restrictions** (`internal/sshproxy/iprestrict.go`): Per-instance source IP whitelisting for SSH connections. Each instance has an optional `AllowedSourceIPs` field (comma-separated IPs and CIDR ranges, e.g., `10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.1.100`). Before the control plane establishes an SSH connection, it determines its outbound IP for the target via UDP probe and verifies it falls within the whitelist. Empty whitelist means no restriction. `ParseIPRestrictions(csv)` returns an `*IPRestriction` with parsed CIDRs and individual IPs. `IsAllowed(ip)` checks membership. `CheckSourceIPAllowed(instanceID, csv, host, port)` is the high-level check used by `EnsureConnectedWithIPCheck`. Blocked attempts are logged and emit connection events. The `ErrIPRestricted` error type includes instance ID, source IP, and reason. Admin-only update via `PUT /api/v1/instances/{id}` with `allowed_source_ips` field (validated server-side). Frontend displays an editable "SSH Source IP Restrictions" section on the instance overview tab (admin only).

**SSH Key Rotation** (`internal/sshkeys/`): Global SSH key pair rotation. `RotateGlobalKeyPair` generates a new ED25519 key pair and safely rotates it across all running instances in a multi-step process: (1) generate new key, (2) append new public key to each instance's `authorized_keys` via orchestrator exec (both keys work temporarily), (3) back up old keys on disk (`ssh_key.old`, `ssh_key.pub.old`), (4) write new keys to disk, (5) reload into SSHManager via `ReloadKeys`, (6) test SSH connectivity with new key per instance, (7) remove old key from instances where new key works (via `ConfigureSSHAccess` overwrite), (8) remove backup files on full success. Partial failures are handled gracefully — instances where the new key fails retain the old key. Instance updates run concurrently. Settings `ssh_key_rotation_policy_days` (default: 90) and `ssh_key_last_rotation` (timestamp) are stored in the settings table. The `RotationOrchestrator` interface requires `ConfigureSSHAccess`, `GetSSHAddress`, and `ExecInInstance`.

**SSH Audit** (`internal/sshaudit/`): Persistent SSH access audit logging backed by a dedicated `ssh_audit_logs` SQLite table. The `Auditor` records seven event types: `connection`, `disconnection`, `command_exec`, `file_operation`, `terminal_session`, `key_upload`, and `key_rotation`. Each `AuditEntry` stores event type, instance ID, user, details, and timestamp. The auditor is initialized in `main.go` with `NewAuditor(db, retentionDays)` which auto-migrates its table. An SSHManager `EventListener` callback automatically logs connection lifecycle events (connect, disconnect, key upload). File operation handlers log browse/read/download/create/mkdir/upload. Terminal handlers log session start/reconnect/detach. Key rotation handlers log both manual and automatic rotations. `Query(opts)` supports filtering by instance ID and event type with pagination (newest first). `PurgeOlderThan(d)` deletes old entries; `StartRetentionCleanup(ctx)` runs daily purge based on `ssh_audit_retention_days` setting (default 90 days). Admin-only API: `GET /api/v1/audit-logs` with `instance_id`, `event_type`, `limit`, `offset` query parameters.

**SSH Terminal** (`internal/sshterminal/`): Interactive terminal sessions over SSH with session persistence. `SessionManager` tracks multiple concurrent sessions per instance, each identified by UUID. Sessions survive WebSocket disconnect (detached state) and can be reconnected via `?session_id=` query parameter. A ring-buffer scrollback captures recent output for replay on reconnect. Optional audit recording writes all session output to timestamped files. Idle detached sessions are reaped after a configurable timeout.

**Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS v4. Uses TanStack React Query for data fetching (5s polling on instance list), React Router for SPA routing, Monaco Editor for JSON config editing, Axios for API calls. The `@` import alias maps to `src/`.


## Configuration

Backend settings use `envconfig` with `CLAWORC_` env prefix (see `internal/config/config.go`):
- `CLAWORC_DATA_PATH` - Data directory for SQLite database and SSH keys (default: `/app/data`)
- `CLAWORC_K8S_NAMESPACE` - Target namespace (default: `claworc`)
- `CLAWORC_TERMINAL_HISTORY_LINES` - Scrollback buffer size in lines (default: `1000`, `0` to disable)
- `CLAWORC_TERMINAL_RECORDING_DIR` - Directory for audit recordings (default: empty, disabled)
- `CLAWORC_TERMINAL_SESSION_TIMEOUT` - Idle detached session timeout (default: `30m`)

## Key Conventions

- K8s-safe instance names are derived from display names: lowercase, hyphens, prefixed with `bot-`, max 63 chars
- API keys are never returned in full by the API -- only masked (`****` + last 4 chars)
- Instance status in API responses is enriched with live K8s/Docker status, not just the DB value
- Global API key changes propagate to all instances without overrides
- Frontend is embedded into the Go binary at build time using `//go:embed`
- SSH connections and tunnels are keyed by instance ID (uint), not name — this ensures stability across 
  renames and avoids name-to-ID mapping overhead
